# Question1

1. You will recall from class 3 primary similarity metrics: (1) Normalized Cross-Correlation, (2) 
Mutual Information, and (3) Sum of Squared Error (also known as sum of squared differ￾ences). Here you will investigate another, Sum of Absolute Difference. Write a function “mySumAbs.m” which computes normalized cross correlation between two input images. 
You will call the function as follows:
R = mySumAbs(image1, image2)
Here R is a measure of how much similarity there is between the two images (R=0 à perfectly similar). 
Paste the code for this function in your submission
